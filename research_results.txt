### XZ Backdoor Overview

In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name "Jia Tan". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution through OpenSSH on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score. While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery, the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on March 29, 2024.

### What is XZ Utils?

XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression, the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.

### Details of the Backdoor

The backdoor was introduced in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of xz Utils, which modified the way the software functions. The malicious code manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote SSH connections. Anyone in possession of a predetermined encryption key could stash any code of their choice in an SSH login certificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. This could allow for various malicious actions, including stealing files or installing malware.

The backdoor was discovered by Andres Freund while troubleshooting performance problems on a Debian system. The malicious changes were submitted by JiaT75, one of the two main xz Utils developers with years of contributions to the project. The backdoor was designed to allow a malicious actor to break the authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system.

### Impact and Response

The backdoor was discovered before the malicious versions of xz Utils were added to production versions of Linux, which significantly reduced its impact. Security teams across various distributions, including Debian and Red Hat, quickly patched the vulnerability. Users were advised to check their systems for the vulnerable versions and update accordingly.

### Conclusion

The XZ backdoor incident highlights the vulnerabilities present in open-source software development, particularly regarding supply chain attacks. It serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and security practices in software development and distribution.
